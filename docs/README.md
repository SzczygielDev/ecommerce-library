# Overview
> This tool is experimental, and it's dedicated to my private projects only.

This library provides reusable building blocks designed for multi-module or microservice-oriented architectures.

Available building blocks:
- Domain-Driven Design abstraction
- Event Store abstraction with both in-memory and persistent implementations
- CQRS abstraction
- Mediator and command pattern
- Outbox Pattern implementation

Some components currently depend on Spring Boot and the [KediatR library](https://github.com/trendyol/kediatr). However, the goal is to make the entire library framework-independent in the future.
